                        <p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
                            Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely
                            regarded
                            as one of the greatest albums of all time. The album features Jimi Hendrix’s innovative
                            approach
                            to
                            songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in
                            psychedelic
                            and
                            hard rock music.</p>

                    <p>In 2013, Mojo magazine listed "Are You Experienced" as the greatest guitar album of all time.

                    <p>The budget for the recordings was rather limited so Chas Chandler (producer) and Hendrix
                        completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment.</p>

                        <p>Axis: Bold as Love is the second studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Track Records
                            first released it in the United Kingdom on December 1, 1967, only seven months after the
                            release of the group’s highly successful debut, Are You Experienced. In the United States,
                            Reprise Records delayed the release until the following month. The album reached the top ten
                            in the album charts in both UK and USA.</p>

                    <p>Axis: Bold As Love’s scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape
                        of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming,
                        Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight
                        session.</p>
                    <p>Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his Native
                        American heritage.</p>
